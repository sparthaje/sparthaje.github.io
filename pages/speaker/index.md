## Design overview
The aux port emits analog signals when playing music, and circuitry needs to be built to take this weak signal and use it to drive a large speaker. My goal with this project was to make the speaker on the left perform at high volumes without noticeable noise.


The circuit:
- First stage combines left and right channel voltage signals
- Op-amp stage amplifies the voltage from `mV` range to the `V` range
- Low-pass RC filter filters out noise added in the amplification process
- Push-pull stage pushes more current into the speakers to drive the large discs

## Designing the low-pass RC filter
The op-amp stage I used to amplify the signal had issues of adding a lot of high frequency noise to the circuit. While a variety of solutions exist, for my first analog circuit I went with a simple RC low-pass filter. Analyzing the signal after amplification in the frequency domain showed the noisy frequencies. Taking into account the frequency range I wanted to filter out along with a 10 `kÎ©` resistor, I could solve for what capacitor I needed.
